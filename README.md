Building a web app along with react native for mobile devices. Had trouble getting project working as directed from video, 
but after installing a few npm packages and researching errors, finally got an initial project rendering.

Finished tutorial and added more pokemon from https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/
Plan is to find a pokemon json to be able to use filter, map reduce to find any pokemon
Also plan to use Matieral-UI to create pokemon cards and decks
